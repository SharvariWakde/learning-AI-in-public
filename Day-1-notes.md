# Day 1 – Understanding How AI Learns (With Code)

## What this code does
This Python script teaches a model to learn the relationship:
y = 2x

It starts with a wrong guess for the weight and improves it step by step.

## Key ideas I understood
- Learning = reducing error
- Gradient descent tells the model which direction to improve
- Weight updates are small but consistent
- Loss going down = learning is happening

## What surprised me
Even this tiny loop behaves like a real neural network training process.
